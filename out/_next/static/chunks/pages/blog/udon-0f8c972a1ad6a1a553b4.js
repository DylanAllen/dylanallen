I have been working on this on nights and weekends for the past several months. My wife and I welcomed a new baby during that time, so I took a break from it for a while, and then picked it back up recently. It is still very much a work in progress, but I got it to a point that I am proud enough to share it with the world. So without further ado, meet Udon: https://github.com/DylanAllen/udon\n\n<figure>\n<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/udon-pm.appspot.com/o/images%2Fudon-homepage.png?alt=media&token=426e47cf-9ba4-48c9-964a-3d1ff1b2d7ba" class="centerimage">\n<figcaption>Here is the homepage with some nonsense data. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br/>\nI started this project because I wanted to build something from the ground up using modern web technologies. I decided to make a project management and time tracking system, because I knew I could build something better for my agency than the system they are using. I have learned so much in the process, and it has been way more fun than I imagined it would. \n\n<figure>\n<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/udon-pm.appspot.com/o/images%2Fudon-project-page.png?alt=media&token=a31ca1fe-d819-42f3-b57a-cfa1352be581" class="centerimage">\n<figcaption>Project detail page with task data, and project chat. Realtime chat, BTW.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br/>\nUdon is build with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), Vue Router, Google\'s [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) database, Firebase authentication, and Firebase storage. I am running my demo site on Firebase hosting as well. So far all of the dev work has been well under the free tier for the Firebase services.\n\n<figure>\n<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/udon-pm.appspot.com/o/images%2Fudon-add-task.png?alt=media&token=9d69b7ce-7e10-432f-a438-9c15c1f88daf" class="centerimage">\n<figcaption>Modal task entry form.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br/>\nOnce this product is ready for prime time I will probably set up a brochure site, outline all of the features, and offer it as a hosted solution if anyone is interested in using it. At the time of this blog post it does the following:\n\n* Tracks basic project & client data\n* Has project summary views in card format (pictured above), and table format\n* Has filter and sort features for project list\n* Allows users to create tasks within projects\n* Allows users to log time to tasks\n* Allows users to review time log data with filter and sort features\n* Has a start & stop timer for time entry that is persistent across pages\n* Has basic user account creation, profile, and password reset functionality\n* Has realtime chat streams within each project\n* Allows users to upload files to each project, download files, and delete files\n\n<br/>\nThat is about it. I would gladly welcome any contributions to the project, and in the near future, I will be looking for a brave agency to volunteer for beta testing!\n'})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{slug:l.slug})]})})}},z61U:function(e,t,o){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/blog/udon",function(){return o("yh2t")}])}},[["z61U",1,2,4,6,0,3,5,7,8]]]);
